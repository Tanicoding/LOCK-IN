# LOCK-IN
LOCK IN is basically your personal clock, but upgraded as you can switch between light, dark, or auto theme, pick any accent color & font size you want, show only analog, only digital, or both. Choose your time zone & 12/24 hr format, show or hide seconds, change how the date looks, set alarms with a beep. Saves all your settings so you donâ€™t have to redo them every time, export your setup if you want to share or back it up.

HTML for the skeleton. CSS for styling, themes, and smooth hand movement. JavaScript for all the logic, updates, and settings handling.

## What's next for LOCK IN
More themes and ready-made color palettes
Subtle background animations (day/night, gradients, etc.)
Maybe add weather & mini calendar right on the clock
